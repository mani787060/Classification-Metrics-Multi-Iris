# Classification Metrics on Multi-Class Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates how to evaluate **multi-class classification models** using the popular **Iris dataset**.  
It includes multiple evaluation metrics to understand how well a classifier performs across all three classes.

## Contents:-
- Train-test split on Iris dataset  
- Training a basic classifier (Logistic Regression / SVM / KNN)  
- Confusion Matrix visualization  
- Multi-class Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Classification Report interpretation  
- Macro vs Micro averaging explained

## Key Concepts:-
- How evaluation differs for multi-class vs binary classification  
- What precision/recall/F1 mean in multi-class settings  
- Using confusion matrix to analyze misclassifications  

## Libraries Used:-
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
